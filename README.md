This project was part of an SQL practice from an SQL bootcamp in UDEMY.

Project was ran using GoormIDE platform.

The data that were inserted to the table were given by the instructor

But the table itself was coded by the project owner(me).

Project is seperated into 3 parts:

1. Creating the table dataset

2. Inserting data into the table

3. Querying the data to extract relevant information:
   a. Finding 5 oldest Users
   b. What day of the week do most users register on?
   c. Identify Inactive Users (users with no photos)
   d. Identify most popular photo (and its creator)
   e. Calculate average number of photos per user
   f. Find the five most popular hashtags
   g. Finding the bots - the users who have liked every single photo
